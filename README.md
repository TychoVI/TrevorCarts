# TrevorCarts

Requires you to up the maxMinecartSpeed using the [experimental datapack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecart_Improvements)

Little plugin I made to allow people to control minecart speed on the trevorcraft survival server.

I threw this together in 2 hours for it to just work don't expect clean architecture or quality code.

I used [MinecartSpeedPlus](https://github.com/rmellis/MinecartSpeedPlus) heavily for inspiration.
